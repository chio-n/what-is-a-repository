## Objective
I want to use this repository to upload my projects.
My goal is to use a dataset to practice analysis and reporting in Excel.  

## Dataset Used 
- Vehicle Sales Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data)

## References 
- [Full Project in Excel | Excel Tutorials for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opJgMj1IUrc&ab_channel=AlexTheAnalyst)

## Step 1: Cleaning and Transformation
- I created the 'Working Sheet,' 'Pivot Table,' and 'Dashboard' sheets while keeping the raw data in 'car_prices' unchanged.
- With the 'Working Sheet' I removed the duplicates.

# Added Vehicle Condition Grades

I added the 'Condition Brackets' column and used the IF function to assign condition grades to each sold vehicle.
- Between 49 to 40 = "Excellent" 
- Between 39 to 30 = "Great" 
- Between 29 to 20 = "Good" 
- Between 19 to 10 = "Fair" 
- Between 9 to 1 = "Poor" 
- 0 values were assigned "N/A"
